The following chat logs are things they claimed went down at the event, and I have no actual proof that what's they're saying is true, so please keep that in mind. During the event members would jokingly do \"hand checks\" to make sure you weren't jerking off during the spicy scenes and yell at people to stop recording \\[(Figure 5)\\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230827041407026/unknown8.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230827041407026/unknown8.png), which I'm assuming is because they knew what they were doing is some degenerate shit and didn't want SA to find out (oops).

Them changing the printed version of the itinerary that was handed out at the event is a clear omission of guilt. What this means is that its very possible some people went to watch a normal movie just to be in a musty room watching \"Sextra Credit\" which apparently is about a student's revenge fantasy against his teachers, which involves heavy themes of rape.

      "After finding out we knew and had some pretty damning evidence, leading members of SAPRA were now on full damage control trying to justify their watch party. Staff were told to ID everyone for the event, given they were apparently going to watch a rated-R movie (not rated X), however this wasn't possible due to staff constraints \\[(figure 8) \\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231499329605723/InkedN2IIzDx\\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231499329605723/InkedN2IIzDx_LI.jpg). This fuck up I'm personally sketched out the most by, since I personally have no idea who is conversing in these screenshots, the person who sent them hid them first. Regardless, it was a stupid ass idea to play hentai in a classroom in the first place.\n",

Assuming their own Facebook page is accurate, that puts this guy in the age range of 29-33 which is beyond weird that he's organizing rape hentai viewing sessions for people he's nearly a decade older than. What makes him even creepier are his messages on the SARPA discord regarding the event.\n",

      "Now, as you could probably tell SARPA's admins are not happy and shitting their pants. They claim we raided their discord and are harassing them. Most would agree what we did was not \"raiding\" a discord. A friend of our was posting this meme \\[(figure 13)\\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231268072468530/mUNN7zE\\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231268072468530/mUNN7zE_LI.jpg) in their discord, and we wanted to see the reaction, so we joined in mass. Not a single one of us were even able to get a message out because their rule requires you to use your real full name on your profile (more on this later). However a single member, whom we don't even know, took it upon himself to do a bit of trolling, changing his name to antagonize them. If you count this single person changing his name to \"rape watch party\" or something along those lines and rejoining three times \"a raid\" then so be it. Now admittedly, I was very tempted to do a bit of trolling as well, mostly just wanted them to know how fucked they are, however I refrained, and never sent anything in their discord (not that we could've anyway). Another claim they make against us is that we doxxed one of their members, which is flat out wrong. One of our members, whom again, I don't know personally and have zero control over, saw that their admins had their real names as their discord profile, which is their rule, and looked it up on linkedIn. Keep in mind, we found this discord link on UBLinked, so their subreddit is pretty public with over 600 members. Maybe change your name on your **600** person discord. So to the person who's \"scared\" we want to dox them, don't be. We think you're absolutely vile and the last thing we want is to know is what you look like. Overall, they're realizing how fucked they are and are resorting to whatever straws they can grasp at, which will likely include slandering us. Consider the substantial amount of evidence I've presented when listening to their side.\n",
