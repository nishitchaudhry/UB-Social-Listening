Vote No on the referendum.

Instead, the funding should come from the members of the organization or through fundraising.

Having said that, the sub has also really started to diverge from the community that it once was, and it‚Äôs really been suffering from some of the issues plaguing other parts of Reddit.

Commenters: 

Let‚Äôs keep things civil. Use the downvote for content you think isn‚Äôt worthwhile (i.e. shitposts). Don‚Äôt start a flame war or an ad hominem attack against the poster.

Posters:

Let‚Äôs try to remember that posts should be relevant to the community and interesting. This sub is a place to post content that other UB students, alumni, or potential students might enjoy. This place is not your diary. 

Mods:

You‚Äôve done a great job bringing this revival of the sub about. Don‚Äôt let it go to shit now after all that work. Posts/comments that are obviously personal attacks against other redditors are 100% against Reddiquette and need to be removed, and repeat offenders need to be banned. I know that you are probably already doing this a ton, but a lot is being overlooked. If the recent influx of posts and comments are too much for you to handle, I‚Äôm sure there are some people here willing to step up and help out. We might also benefit from creating some additional sub rules of our own that specifically address shitposting and personal attacks.

Let‚Äôs all step up and improve the sub for our own sake and the sake of future potential students coming here to see if UB is a good fit for them."

The main goal is for me to lose weight and get yolked and for you to not be built like a bundle of twigs. I will look over your goals and you will look over mine like a brotherhood and we will both create an inseparable gym bro bond kind of like Arnold and Franco (EXCEPT NATTY). I'm looking for serious inquiries only. HMU."

Everytime I see a meme about how we don't have a spring break I cant help but think back to a poll I made about student striking upon hearing that intial decision. It got a pretty pessimistic response and I got down voted to hell in the comments for voicing my 'feelings'. Yes, this post comes from an incredibly salty place but it is also to say I feel like a good chunk of why UB gets away with treating students like machines is because many of the students lie down and take it under the guise of being able to 'push through the struggle'. Not everything has to be a struggle, and you don't look stronger for choosing to let your mental health suffer at the hands of non-stop zoom meetings...you look like a sad clown who truly believes filing out the course evals is a better way to *really stick it to em*. If they're not listening to us when we don't follow their direction in protest, they're sure as hell not gonna listen to us when we put up with their nonsense and complain the ""right"" way, halfway through the semester, when our mentals have already been fried. Even if it was truly a stupid idea (sure there could be flaws, I won't argue that) there were enough people to vote that I would've expected at least a small bit of discussion, or for litterally anyone else to offer ideas on convincing administration. 

Now this GME thing is happening and showing us that yes, when people work togther, things sometimes happen, rigid ways of doing business sometimes break. I noticed some professors took it upon themselves to lighten to course work or even not assign anything this week....when we were supposed to be on break. They didn't need to do that; administration said really said ""by all means keep them just as busy this week if not more"". And yet they did.. they took it upon themselves to try to alleviate student stress. Even if admin did nothing, what professor is going to be the asshat that penalizes every student choosing to black out their zoom for the week in protest of no spring break. How are you gonna enforce a continuance in teaching when there are no students present to teach?  

Again, this venting is purely caused by my inability to harbor this much salt in my being at once. But yes,  from here on out I'll just keep my nose in my books and do my course work through the massive stress headache and depressies. Its fiiiiinnneee.

Man, I can\'t believe half of the crap I used to come up with back in the day.\n\nProbably one of my best memories (way too many to actually get into right now) was the advent of forum football.

Eventually the forum would grow and someone would create a search engine called Resnester that would index these shares.\n\nIn early September 2011, vegans were chalking North Campus, so the people of the UUBNF decided to chalk the campus in response to this, the day of their chalking: September 10th, 2011. This is how I found out about the forum. \n\nThe forum grew beyond file sharing and become a sort of community at UB. AIM and message boards were really the way to go, facebook was years away. \n\nWe had a mega photoshop battle thread, a second chalking event (this time a plane crashed into a building in Florida the day after). Parties were planned, friends were made, certain events (like the ONE time UB closed in my time there) were posted about. \nAs the forum grew older, so did its main users, by 2004, facebook came to UB and the original users of the UB forum began to graduate and move on. \n\nResnester was shut down sometime in 2003 and in its place direct connect hubs were created, (Bizzarro and others). The creators of these hubs were from UUBNF, however, they were shut down as well and around 2010, the forum was all but dead.

Here is an except from a good post to illustrate to you the threat:\n\nLet\'s stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: ""*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* "" [\\[1\\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)\n\nSince H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you\'ve probably had it at one point or another -- it\'s just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...\n\nFirst off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it\'s one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\\[4\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it\'ll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\\[5\\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&geo1=01). There\'s also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\\[6\\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/).\n\nBuddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is \'Map Virus\' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that\'s how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one \'chad spreader\'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it\'ll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it\'s already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\\[8\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).\n\nWhat matters is that we can see that something like \\~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \\~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \\~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire...\n\nIf we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we\'ve got evidence of that already [\\[9\\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).\n\nBut that\'s not all.

The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it\'s highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\\[11\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what\'s going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.\n\nSo let\'s get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\\[12\\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \\~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.\n\nHowever, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we\'re looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we\'re looking at a total of \\~60.8 million infected in a year\'s time.

It sucks sometimes but the Bills are Buffalo's main sports team."", ""rm_a: amazing post - so awesome to see someone who has a real understanding of the university and the economics of being popular in D1 anything.  I am a UB grad; and went to Boston College (was enrolled as an MBA student the year Matt Ryan and the Eagles were #2 in the country) for grad school.\n\nFor me, number 1, it's about fielding a good team - there has to be something on field for the student body to rally around.  This should be easy enough to do in the MAC (though, if we were an SEC team, I would argue it wouldn't matter if we won or lost - given every away team would bring massive #'s to Buffalo and make the town explode with culture).  BUT we should win the MAC consistently - every year - and we will be relevant.\n\nSecond, the tailgating/game day culture - it can't be that one giant F150 party in the lots near Jacobs.  It has to be every car and every truck creating a gameday experience.\n\nThird, NYBulls was the best thing.  Danny White knows/knew what he was doing it. Market the shit out of UB and make it the flagship, whether officially designated or not.  It's a big school with an attractive stadium (sans the end zone speakers - PLEASE spend some money and put in a surround sound to amplify the band and some attractive 360 graphics that wrap the stadium) - there is nothing here holding UB back. It even has a bar in the stadium!\n\nFourth, retire Starks and Mack's jerseys now.  Start building a tradition and an expectation of excellence.  UB produces NFL players in football.  We need to become the RB Univ or the DB Univ.  Buffalo is a breeding ground for overlooked talent - we should OWN this category and be the school where Rudy's go.\n\nFifth - The more money  that goes into Football and Basketball, the bigger the program gets, the bigger the school gets, and the bigger every other sport and the value of your degree gets.  EVERYONE should get behind the sports program.  Market the piss out of it; talk about it; make it huge and big.  Buffalo IS a football town - Buffalo fans WILL travel when there is a reason to do so (dude, my bus driver in 7th grader (1989) had no money and still afforded to go to every away game she could because she wanted to see the Bills and Kelly win).  We have fans and we have motivation - we need to tap into this."", ""It's thanksgiving break bruh. "", 'MAC needs to change the rules to allow beer to be sold in the stands.

They want to make money and that is it.\n* Politics: Did you know that ""University at Buffalo"" keeps more of UB\'s money at UB? ""State University of New York at Buffalo"" sends more of UB\'s money into the State General funds coffer.\n* The new logo was a smack in the face for Buffalo. No one else in New York gives a crap about the team and sees it as representative of the state and to demote the local area\'s name in an attempt to sell a farce just didn\'t sit well. Local\'s no longer felt any semblence of an attachment to the team. Think about this. The Buffalo Bills are the only New York State NFL team that play in New York State. If they became the New York Bills, an apocalypse would a holiday compared to what would happen.\n\nLike I said, there is more to the complexity of the University at Buffalo and its attendance at games.

The middle of your week may feel long depending on how you like each of the classes- you start around 9 and end after 6 for Tuesday-Thursday. Your start and end to the week will be easier. I suggest definitely utilizing your breaks on your Wednesday to grab something to eat (so around 12 and 5) and potentially grabbing snacks from vending machines as needed. Tuesday and Thursday are a bit more difficult in terms of breaking, although 25/30 minutes isn't awful. I'd say for those to just give yourself a breather...don't worry about trying to do work when you had finished one class and are preparing for another. Just allow for a natural transition and prep.\n\nWhen it comes to the longer breaks, you could go about getting work done ahead of time so you can stay on top of things and (hopefully) stress less. Friday is by far the best opportunity for that, but Monday is a great contender as well. Even the time between the two classes could qualify as getting some more progress on work done if you feel up to it.
