First, we have labs that have instructions that are extremely confusing to understand. When we are in lab doing the in lab assignments that are due by the end of the lab time the TA’s don’t go over instructions they just have us get right into it without us knowing if we’ve done the pre lab right or not. So we have to wait for them to get around to everyone when we need help which is all the time. The TA’s tend to question themselves a lot on whether or not they’re giving us the right information to help us which is super frustrating. Then we get told we have to read the instructions carefully… like okay but it’s confusing. Then this is where it gets me they come back to us saying “sorry we gave you wrong steps, the instructions are actually confusing, we might talk to the professor about it, this must be so stressful for you guys” Um yeah it is because it seems like nobody knows what they’re doing even the TA’s, so don’t tell us we have to read the instructions carefully to refrain from making a mistake. Next, we had an exam a room full of about 200 people, you would figure that they made sure we all got the right exam before having us take it. 30 minutes into the exam the instructors come to find out that some of the exams are for a different course so those students that got the wrong exam had to go to the front and get the right one and start from the beginning again. After the exam a student commented on the course app that we use, that they heard that some students got the wrong exam but they did not hear the announcement of when they found out because they had finished the exam before then and left so they did not know if they had the wrong exam or not. Then the instructor replies saying “on every page inside the exam said the course number, we did tell you guys to read over the entire exam before beginning it” like okay but it legit took 30 minutes for everyone to realize that some wrong exams were handed out. The exams even had our names printed on them. So how are you going to say we should’ve read every corner of each page when we know that we all must have the right exams because our names are literally printed on them which means that it should be OUR exam for OUR course. When you teach multiple courses you should be the one reading every corner to make sure your students get the right exam before handing them out and having us start it, it is not our fault that a lot of us got the wrong exam and definitely not our fault for not making sure we read that tiny print in the corners for our course name in time."

While vaccinated people can still get sick, it's less so (hopefully) thus minimal infection window - and since they can still catch it, and they feel less sick, it means they become hosts to infect the unvaccinated. \n\nIn essence, I can still catch covid despite the 2.5 shots but I am less infectious than someone without said minimum 2 shots. \n\nBesides, if you have a legitimate medical reason to not be vaccinated, it's in your best interest to be tested anyways since you likely have immune issues.

Does this make sense? Seems like they're trying to make it hard for unvaccinated students, or push em to get vaccinated when they don't want to. And segregating the minority from events.

So if you're covid positive, as long as you're vaccinated, they don't really care and you can still go to events.

What happens if you already have antibodies? Most of the population has gotten covid and recovered. There's no talk about them being excluded from events on campus, which are the majority of the unvaccinated.

Now, let me say vaccines are effective. But why aren't we considering natural antibodies when allowing people to go to events? They require a vaccine pass, excluding those who have natural immunity.

Instead, the funding should come from the members of the organization or through fundraising.

We’ve helped a ton of students struggling at UB, students thinking about whether to come here, and everyone in between.

Having said that, the sub has also really started to diverge from the community that it once was, and it’s really been suffering from some of the issues plaguing other parts of Reddit. Rampant shit posts, flame wars, ad hominem attacks, etc. have started to make this place less welcoming to newcomers, and we’ve already seen a number of posts by potential students worried that UB has a toxic community because of these things. We all share a degree of responsibility for this (I admit I’ve been a participant in the flame wars and bad behavior too), so it’s up to us to make a change. 

Commenters: 

Let’s keep things civil. Use the downvote for content you think isn’t worthwhile (i.e. shitposts). Don’t start a flame war or an ad hominem attack against the poster. If your argument why some post is bad involves you calling someone “autistic”, you need to re-evaluate how you’re choosing to communicate your thoughts to others, because you’re being an unhelpful asshole. This sub and the other redditors are not a punching bag to take your frustrations out on.

Posters:

Let’s try to remember that posts should be relevant to the community and interesting. This sub is a place to post content that other UB students, alumni, or potential students might enjoy. This place is not your diary. 

Mods:

You’ve done a great job bringing this revival of the sub about. Don’t let it go to shit now after all that work. Posts/comments that are obviously personal attacks against other redditors are 100% against Reddiquette and need to be removed, and repeat offenders need to be banned. I know that you are probably already doing this a ton, but a lot is being overlooked. If the recent influx of posts and comments are too much for you to handle, I’m sure there are some people here willing to step up and help out. We might also benefit from creating some additional sub rules of our own that specifically address shitposting and personal attacks.

Let’s all step up and improve the sub for our own sake and the sake of future potential students coming here to see if UB is a good fit for them."

There's currently a vote going on to make one of the student mandatory fees optional (and increase it). While you may be able to pay it no problem, not everyone can. In fact. Most students would be able to put that money to good use surviving college. Please, vote to make it optional.

Not everything has to be a struggle, and you don't look stronger for choosing to let your mental health suffer at the hands of non-stop zoom meetings...you look like a sad clown who truly believes filing out the course evals is a better way to *really stick it to em*. If they're not listening to us when we don't follow their direction in protest, they're sure as hell not gonna listen to us when we put up with their nonsense and complain the ""right"" way, halfway through the semester, when our mentals have already been fried. Even if it was truly a stupid idea (sure there could be flaws, I won't argue that) there were enough people to vote that I would've expected at least a small bit of discussion, or for litterally anyone else to offer ideas on convincing administration. 

Now this GME thing is happening and showing us that yes, when people work togther, things sometimes happen, rigid ways of doing business sometimes break. I noticed some professors took it upon themselves to lighten to course work or even not assign anything this week....when we were supposed to be on break. They didn't need to do that; administration said really said ""by all means keep them just as busy this week if not more"". And yet they did.. they took it upon themselves to try to alleviate student stress. Even if admin did nothing, what professor is going to be the asshat that penalizes every student choosing to black out their zoom for the week in protest of no spring break. How are you gonna enforce a continuance in teaching when there are no students present to teach?  

Again, this venting is purely caused by my inability to harbor this much salt in my being at once. But yes,  from here on out I'll just keep my nose in my books and do my course work through the massive stress headache and depressies. Its fiiiiinnneee.

I cant wait to get tf out of here."

I was trying to reminisce today and found that the forum was gone and, much to my surprise, found this thread after a ""rowdy uubnf"" query. HA! I must say that I am honored to be mentioned, thought of and still remembered by some. Man, I can\'t believe half of the crap I used to come up with back in the day.\n\nProbably one of my best memories (way too many to actually get into right now) was the advent of forum football. The UUBNF had a large following of very diverse students and, it must have been around the year 2000, that a bunch of us started a weekend tradition of forum football to help (ha) with our inevitable hangover from the previous night. Forum Football lasted for quite a while. I even came back a year or two after graduating to see if it was still going and it was, a very pleasant surprise indeed.\n\nAnd the freaking flame wars I used to have with those douches Ambassador and Yoasif.

In the late 90s, people were sharing files on the UB dorm network using windows shares. Eventually the forum would grow and someone would create a search engine called Resnester that would index these shares.\n\nIn early September 2011, vegans were chalking North Campus, so the people of the UUBNF decided to chalk the campus in response to this, the day of their chalking: September 10th, 2011. This is how I found out about the forum. \n\nThe forum grew beyond file sharing and become a sort of community at UB. AIM and message boards were really the way to go, facebook was years away. \n\nWe had a mega photoshop battle thread, a second chalking event (this time a plane crashed into a building in Florida the day after). Parties were planned, friends were made, certain events (like the ONE time UB closed in my time there) were posted about. \nAs the forum grew older, so did its main users, by 2004, facebook came to UB and the original users of the UB forum began to graduate and move on. \n\nResnester was shut down sometime in 2003 and in its place direct connect hubs were created, (Bizzarro and others). The creators of these hubs were from UUBNF, however, they were shut down as well and around 2010, the forum was all but dead.

If you did and she refused to allow you to come another time, then that would be a problem but I have a feeling that's not the case. \n\n2.)

Not only does Clizbe not care for her students grades she has specifically designed the course for students to fail.

This is my second time taking CHE 121 and honestly I’m questioning if I should have even failed the first time, since she never allowed us to view the tests unless during office hours, which were during another class for me. Not only this but the one office hours I was able to attend be belittled me for asking for help. 

This class has negatively affected my mental health since her inability to admit to mistakes has negatively impacted my grades and has made me feel incompetent. She makes her students feel like failures as she refuses to admit that she can make a mistake. She addressed the previous reddit post about her but did not address the concern and instead trying to glorify herself and blame the computer program, which she inputted the answers for. Seriously, how difficult would it be to include multiple answers for a question or return points to a student who very clearly got a right answer. She also refuses to give partial credit if an answer is right but has a wrong unit or forgotten parentheses."

Here is an except from a good post to illustrate to you the threat:\n\nLet\'s stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: ""*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* "" [\\[1\\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)\n\nSince H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you\'ve probably had it at one point or another -- it\'s just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...\n\nFirst off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it\'s one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\\[4\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it\'ll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\\[5\\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&geo1=01). There\'s also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\\[6\\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/).\n\nBuddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is \'Map Virus\' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that\'s how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one \'chad spreader\'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it\'ll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it\'s already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\\[8\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).\n\nWhat matters is that we can see that something like \\~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \\~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \\~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire...\n\nIf we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we\'ve got evidence of that already [\\[9\\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).\n\nBut that\'s not all.

The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it\'s highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\\[11\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what\'s going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.\n\nSo let\'s get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\\[12\\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \\~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.\n\nHowever, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we\'re looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we\'re looking at a total of \\~60.8 million infected in a year\'s time. This corresponds to \\~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \\~1.16m people dead [\\[14\\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza).', 'Stop fearmongering, our age group has a fatality rate of .2% not the 2.5% that’s you’re claiming.
