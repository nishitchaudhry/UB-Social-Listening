This organization has also been aggressively spreading anti abortion and WOMENS rights propaganda. \n\n[More here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcBohoTLRIq/?utm_medium=copy_link)',"['protest', 'allen', 'west', 'space', 'racism', 'young', 'americans', 'freedom', 'organization', 'have', 'conference', 'state', 'racism', 'america', 'real', 'white', 'space', 'fund', 'school', 'allen', 'west', 'compare', 'lgbtq+', 'person', 'choose', 'favorite', 'flavor', 'cream', 'allen', 'west', 'invalidate', 'entire', 'black', 'experience', 'say', 'choose', 'lgbtq+', 'real', 'organization', 'aggressively', 'spread', 'anti', 'abortion', 'womens', 'right', 'propaganda', '\\n\\n[more', 'here](https://www.instagram.com', 'ccbohotlriq/?utm_medium', 'copy_link']",protest allen west space racism young americans freedom organization have conference state racism america real white space fund school allen west compare lgbtq+ person choose favorite flavor cream allen west invalidate entire black experience say choose lgbtq+ real organization aggressively spread anti abortion womens right propaganda \n\n[more here](https://www.instagram.com ccbohotlriq/?utm_medium copy_link

3770,"Hey everyone, I’m a grad student and a TA at UB, and if none of your professors or TAs have told you this yet this semester - you should be really proud of yourselves. Even if your grade isn’t what you want it to be, even if you felt like you were drowning, and struggling all semester, you should be PROUD. Nothing is okay right now. Nothing is normal. But you still tried, and you still came out on the other side. 

I’ve gotten so many emails from students panicking this semester, and telling me all of the problems they’re having, and it breaks my heart to see how heartless and ignorant some professors and TAs are being during this time. I’m truly sorry if you had an experience like this, but please don’t let it stop you from reaching out to your teachers and TAs in the future. We are not all cold assholes.

I will not talk too much about this because that isn’t the point of this post. Consider this: As a public forum that is representative of all the values and ideals of the University at Buffalo, you are harboring a community with a skewed perspective of what’s going on, a perspective that destroys one man while defending another. We need new moderators who allow open minded, non-malicious ideas to persist, not just a small group with the same destructive beliefs. That’s not who we are. For those of you who have removed posts, you should really be ashamed of yourselves, you are part of the problem.

3839,"Over this school year, we’ve seen a huge revitalization of the sub. It hasn’t been this active in years, and I credit the mods (new and old) and the members of the community posting interesting and relevant content leading to excellent discussions. We’ve helped a ton of students struggling at UB, students thinking about whether to come here, and everyone in between.

Having said that, the sub has also really started to diverge from the community that it once was, and it’s really been suffering from some of the issues plaguing other parts of Reddit. Rampant shit posts, flame wars, ad hominem attacks, etc. have started to make this place less welcoming to newcomers, and we’ve already seen a number of posts by potential students worried that UB has a toxic community because of these things. We all share a degree of responsibility for this (I admit I’ve been a participant in the flame wars and bad behavior too), so it’s up to us to make a change. 

Commenters: 

Let’s keep things civil. Use the downvote for content you think isn’t worthwhile (i.e. shitposts). Don’t start a flame war or an ad hominem attack against the poster. If your argument why some post is bad involves you calling someone “autistic”, you need to re-evaluate how you’re choosing to communicate your thoughts to others, because you’re being an unhelpful asshole. This sub and the other redditors are not a punching bag to take your frustrations out on.

Posters:

Let’s try to remember that posts should be relevant to the community and interesting. This sub is a place to post content that other UB students, alumni, or potential students might enjoy. This place is not your diary. 

Mods:

You’ve done a great job bringing this revival of the sub about. Don’t let it go to shit now after all that work. Posts/comments that are obviously personal attacks against other redditors are 100% against Reddiquette and need to be removed, and repeat offenders need to be banned. I know that you are probably already doing this a ton, but a lot is being overlooked. If the recent influx of posts and comments are too much for you to handle, I’m sure there are some people here willing to step up and help out. We might also benefit from creating some additional sub rules of our own that specifically address shitposting and personal attacks.

Let’s all step up and improve the sub for our own sake and the sake of future potential students coming here to see if UB is a good fit for them.","['school', 'see', 'huge', 'revitalization', 'active', 'year', 'credit', 'mod', 'member', 'community', 'post', 'interesting', 'relevant', 'content', 'lead', 'excellent', 'discussion', 'help', 'student', 'struggle', 'student', 'think', 'come', 'having', 'say', 'start', 'diverge', 'community', 'suffer', 'issue', 'plague', 'part', 'reddit', 'rampant', 'post', 'flame', 'war', 'hominem', 'attack', 'start', 'place', 'welcome', 'newcomer', 'see', 'number', 'post', 'potential', 'student', 'worry', 'toxic', 'community', 'thing', 'share', 'degree', 'responsibility', 'admit', 'participant', 'flame', 'war', 'behavior', 'change', 'commenter', 'thing', 'civil', 'downvote', 'content', 'think', 'worthwhile', 'shitpost', 'start', 'flame', 'hominem', 'attack', 'poster', 'argument', 'post', 'involve', 'call', 'autistic', 'need', 'evaluate', 'choose', 'communicate', 'thought', 'unhelpful', 'asshole', 'redditor', 'punching', 'frustration', 'poster', 'remember', 'post', 'relevant', 'community', 'interesting', 'place', 'post', 'content', 'student', 'alumnus', 'potential', 'student', 'enjoy', 'place', 'diary', 'mod', 'great', 'bring', 'revival', 'work', 'post', 'comment', 'obviously', 'personal', 'attack', 'redditor', 'reddiquette', 'need', 'remove', 'repeat', 'offender', 'need', 'ban', 'know', 'probably', 'overlook', 'recent', 'influx', 'post', 'comment', 'handle', 'sure', 'willing', 'step', 'help', 'benefit', 'create', 'additional', 'rule', 'specifically', 'address', 'shitposte', 'personal', 'attack', 'step', 'improve', 'sake', 'sake', 'future', 'potential', 'student', 'come']",school see huge revitalization active year credit mod member community post interesting relevant content lead excellent discussion help student struggle student think come having say start diverge community suffer issue plague part reddit rampant post flame war hominem attack start place welcome newcomer see number post potential student worry toxic community thing share degree responsibility admit participant flame war behavior change commenter thing civil downvote content think worthwhile shitpost start flame hominem attack poster argument post involve call autistic need evaluate choose communicate thought unhelpful asshole redditor punching frustration poster remember post relevant community interesting place post content student alumnus potential student enjoy place diary mod great bring revival work post comment obviously personal attack redditor reddiquette need remove repeat offender need ban know probably overlook recent influx post comment handle sure willing step help benefit create additional rule specifically address shitposte personal attack step improve sake sake future potential student come

All the SJWs that went up to speak need to grow up because you just made yourself look stupid.

I hope we have more conservative leaning speakers in the future to spark more discussions although it isn’t all that likely because whenever someone isn’t far left this campus goes crazy.

3868,"Is it enough to try and do anything about it as a community, or just enough to complain? Everytime I see a meme about how we don't have a spring break I cant help but think back to a poll I made about student striking upon hearing that intial decision. It got a pretty pessimistic response and I got down voted to hell in the comments for voicing my 'feelings'. Yes, this post comes from an incredibly salty place but it is also to say I feel like a good chunk of why UB gets away with treating students like machines is because many of the students lie down and take it under the guise of being able to 'push through the struggle'. Not everything has to be a struggle, and you don't look stronger for choosing to let your mental health suffer at the hands of non-stop zoom meetings...you look like a sad clown who truly believes filing out the course evals is a better way to *really stick it to em*. If they're not listening to us when we don't follow their direction in protest, they're sure as hell not gonna listen to us when we put up with their nonsense and complain the ""right"" way, halfway through the semester, when our mentals have already been fried. Even if it was truly a stupid idea (sure there could be flaws, I won't argue that) there were enough people to vote that I would've expected at least a small bit of discussion, or for litterally anyone else to offer ideas on convincing administration. 

Now this GME thing is happening and showing us that yes, when people work togther, things sometimes happen, rigid ways of doing business sometimes break. I noticed some professors took it upon themselves to lighten to course work or even not assign anything this week....when we were supposed to be on break. They didn't need to do that; administration said really said ""by all means keep them just as busy this week if not more"". And yet they did.. they took it upon themselves to try to alleviate student stress. Even if admin did nothing, what professor is going to be the asshat that penalizes every student choosing to black out their zoom for the week in protest of no spring break. How are you gonna enforce a continuance in teaching when there are no students present to teach?  

Again, this venting is purely caused by my inability to harbor this much salt in my being at once. But yes,  from here on out I'll just keep my nose in my books and do my course work through the massive stress headache and depressies. Its fiiiiinnneee.

3894,"UB can not legitimately send people home and expect them to come back without serious consequences. If people come back and and just one person goes home and gets it we will not know it has been spreading amongst us until the end of the week we get back. If they want the school open the only option is to dissalow people going home or have people go home and stay home. It will really royally fuck Buffalo if a single person comes back from spring break with cornoa. Which is an extremely high possibility given New York is now the most infected state. 

At this point they have to be waiting until Friday to tell us to stop any panic. Most likely they will tell us all to pack for a more permanent stay at home during the break. Otherwise we deserve to lose any medical school related accreditation due to the sheer stupidity of the faculty.

Will we really be barred from campus if it hasn't been 14 days since our shot?

3902,"Hi, I have Clyde Herreid for Bio 200 and Gershon Sageev for Calc 121. Just curious, what is the curve like for those two classes for those who had him? 

If you would be so kind to attach or to cite the curve that you received and how much it boosted your grade (that is, if you had a raw score of 50%-->this is just an example, not my grade, and it went up to an 85%, then that would be a 35% curve... something like that)... I'm well above average in both classes, but I'm just a little bit concerned...
