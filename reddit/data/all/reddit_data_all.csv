Fuck if I’ll be associated now. We’ll never know who it was.', ""From my knowledge, this year's SARPA/Anime E-Board were very disorganized this year as a result of not having experience from running UBCon previously (former organizers have already graduated, and the COVID gap left new E-Board without much experience running a huge event). However, they're not the victims here.\n\nThe first question that came to mind for me, well before this past weekend, is why the current E-Board didn't bother to reach out to previous E-Board graduates for help or advice on how to run UBCon. That would've saved lots of time and energy both before and (especially now) after the event. Their excuse might be that its organized by students and we're busy, but that means you already know you're busy and you should ask for more help.\n\nThen there's the scapegoat guy from 2011. This was absolutely shocking for me since I didn't find out about it until now. Who is this guy, and why is he *still* involved with an *undergraduate* event at that level?\n\nLet's get to the event itself. If you've weighed all the pros and cons of running an 18+ event of that nature and *still* decide to do it, it would still seem only logical that you should have *way* more personnel to cover ID checks and attendee monitoring. If you don't have the people, don't have the event. Even then, I was told in the weeks before UBCon that *all* content shown would be censored. Showing censored content on a site that shows other uncensored content such as advertisements should not be excused. If you can't be responsible, you can't have this event. On top of that, who thought it was a good idea to pull up X-rated sites on a university computer?\n\nSA isn't totally off the hook either, as they are the ones responsible for making sure that this event is approved. With the amount of issues they've had in various departments this past year, I wouldn't be surprised if they just gave up on thoroughly checking on each event under UBCon's schedule. That being said, there is a possibility that the E-Board knew about this and used that knowledge to lie about the true purpose of the event.\n\nAfter speaking to several people within the club on occasion, I can make an assumption that these people are also not ones to take responsibility for their own mistakes and apologize or provide explanations, so you might be hard pressed to get any response from the organizers. SA is just SA, so you might not get a response very soon from them either.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the people (including myself) who were running their own event at UBCon are now inadvertently tied to this whole fiasco, even if they had zero involvement or knowledge of Hentai Theater."", 'I\'m probably going to get downvoted as hell for writing this, but I feel the need to clear up a couple of things regarding the event. Keep in mind, I am not a member of SARPA, nor did I attend the hentai screening, and I am in no way saying that any criticism of them is unwarranted, especially lying to SA about the event and having a public screening of X-rated material that heavily featured rape. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) The actual likelihood of minors attending the screening is incredibly low, near zero. In order to attend the event, you had to have had a badge for UBCon and to do that, you either had to be 18+ and provide ID or be accompanied by a parent or guardian the entire time. They wouldn\'t need to ID everyone at the hentai screening, since everyone there would be wearing their badge. That being said, the amount of security they did have, as you described, was definitely unacceptable since the chance of minor getting in, however slim the chance was, still existed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) My understanding is that there is this very weird subculture within hentai viewing where people will watch them not to jerk off but to enjoy them ironically and poke fun at the ridiculous scenarios and usually awful animation that are in them. It\'s not to dissimilar to the fact that ""What are you doing stepbro?"" is currently a fairly well known meme. Judging by the use of MST3K in the event name, that\'s probably what the event was meant to be, though naturally the event probably attracted a lot of weirdos who were there for the more usual reason one watches hentai. The argument can also be made that you need to be really deep into hentai to be able to enjoy it ironically. Also, the particular hentai that they chose to screen was definitely a poor choice since, no matter how you slice it, rape isn\'t something to joke about, and there are likely much more tame hentai they they could still riff on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all being said, it definitely doesn\'t help that this was one of the few events going on at the convention, (I only went so I could buy some model kits from local businesses that attended, since there weren\'t any panels that interested me,) or that the headlining guest, Quinton Reviews, has a history of playing into the r/niceguys stereotype by behaving inappropriately with female colleagues, getting called out for it and then turning to his fanbase for pity, who don\'t have the context. While I\'m not against the idea of the event, per se, this is definitely something that should have been done in private and making it a public thing and lying to SA about it was an awful move on SARPA\'s part and really doesn\'t do anything than maintain a false image of what enjoying nerd stuff, whether that be comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy books and films and even anime or manga, is really about.', '!remindme 1 week', 'Giving weebs a bad name 😭', 'Yoooo this shit is crazy as hell. Imagine having class in that room.', 'Yeah, SARPA deserves to be ended', 'It would be a shame if the news got a hold of this', 'Interesting', 'Put me in the screenshot', 'LMFAO', 'fuck weebs', 'This has to be an inside snitching job, no one just stumbles into this lmaooooo', 'This is not a ""secret hentai watch party"" - it\'s just an event at UB Con. It seems it was was mislabeled this year (even so, it was still labeled as 18+), but previous years it was literally called Mystery Hentai Theater. It\'s not ""secret"" and it\'s definitely not people jerking it to porn in a lecture hall. It\'s just a fun time where they show a bad/ridiculous hentai and heckle it while it plays, like the namesake.', 'lmao', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/UBreddit/comments/d7uru7/questionalbe_class_material/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf wonder if it’s connected\n\nedit: https://www.reddit.com/r/UBreddit/comments/sn0rpp/love_to_see_the_campus_diversity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nunder our noses for a long time', 'Hol up gonna get down voted real quick:\n\nThe possibility of having minors walking in is your one valid concern, but the chance of it is pretty close to none. All minors had to be accompanied by an adult to be allowed anywhere in the con, but if someone checking for badges messed up, I can see the problem. \n\nThe entire event IS ironic. It\'s hard to believe that a ""avid Japanese cartoon enjoyer"" can\'t find the hilarity in gathering people into a lecture hall to watch weird hentai on the big screen and do ""hand checks."" Pretty fucking funny to me. \n\nSo it\'s pretty obvious the main objective of this post is to stir shit up and to shame people. S it witch hunting season? All of this ""investigation"" done is stuff that was very available to everyone who wanted to take two seconds to look for it. I\'m just disappointed all these people have fallen for your narrative. \n\nAs for the rape hentai, yes it\'s in poor taste. I\'d say at least 85% of hentai is. But again the entire point of an event like this was to make fun of the hentai not sit around and coom in a room, which is what you\'re making it sound like to people who don\'t know any better.\n\nThe smell in Knox110? You could easily find some questionable smells in any room at UB. Nothing gets cleaned for shit. Chances of some dude nutting on a seat infront of everyone that attended? Low. Chances of finding questionable smells in any UB classroom? Very high.\n\nIf you personally have a problem with the event, you could take it up with the club itself. But again, it\'s pretty obvious this post was made to point a big finger at something and get everyone else to point with you.', '""Secret"" lmao this isn\'t a secret at all, SA always has to approve everything that\'s printed out, which includes those schedules. (I know this because I was VP of a different club and they constantly yelled at us to put the SA logo on things 🙄) And you have to show your ID to get in to 18+ events too. Idk why everyone is trying to insist that this is some sort of secret conspiracy. I attended UBcon when I was a teenager, before I even knew I was gonna go to UB, and I knew about the explicit events back then.\nI\'d also like to mention that as a previous UB Student, I know that some actual UB classes screen content that includes porn and sexual assault. So if you\'re a student then it\'s even less of a shocker that this event occurs.\n\nEdit: I\'ve been informed by a current student that last week was UB\'s sex week, that makes this whole thing so funny lmao', 'Who cares? Find something better to do with your time', '[deleted]', ""It's literally a cartoon porn. So much wasted energy. Of all things to die on a hill for lol. Imagine thinking that this has any impact on anyone's lives. Focus on something that actually matters. I could care less if they stop doing this. If you think that people under age don't sneak into shit they don't belong in then you clearly don't know teenagers."", ""This has been public knowledge for literal years and it's an 18+ event, why are you pretending this is a problem?"", '20 bucks this is one of the mid-50s salty founders of UB Con trying to get it canceled because ""it\'s not a gaming convention anymore""\n\nThey were the only people ever mad about anime showing up and ""ruining"" it.\n\nI also have some reassuring news about those white stains on your seat - turns out, people sometimes spill milk when eating/drinking in class and spoiled milk smells far worse than old jizzstains.', '[deleted]']",UBreddit,"tldr; during UB con, UB SARPA and Anime Office leaders most likely lied to the Student Association so they could host their yearly hentai watch party at Knox 110.\*\*

This is going to be a long post about some pretty foul shit that went down at Saturday's UBcon by the  members of the anime office/SARPA (I'm going to refer to them as SARPA), and some drama that followed. Sorry if the formatting is shit. All of this took place yesterday afternoon and evening. Please keep in mind all the information I'm getting is second-hand, and I wasn't actually present at these events, so based off the information I provide, formulate your own opinion.  I will not be dropping any names for privacy sake. Both the Student Association and Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion were provided many of the same screenshots you're seeing, however I urge you to also let them know if you think this is disgusting behavior.

Da Context

First things first, how did a normie such as myself learn about such an exclusive event? Well, a member of my discord was talking about the event since they were there, and I couldn't believe it. \[(Figure 1)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230827255300116/Inkedunknown4\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230827255300116/Inkedunknown4_LI.jpg) . My members of my discord and I asked for proof they provided screenshots of pictures they took at Knox 110 of them trying to find an unblocked website, and actually watching the hentai. \[(Figure 2) \] [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230743079837706/unknown3.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230743079837706/unknown3.png)\[(Figure 3)\]([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230743440539708/unknown1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230743440539708/unknown1.png)) and \[(Figure 4)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230743784460288/unknown2.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230743784460288/unknown2.png)). The following chat logs are things they claimed went down at the event, and I have no actual proof that what's they're saying is true, so please keep that in mind. During the event members would jokingly do ""hand checks"" to make sure you weren't jerking off during the spicy scenes and yell at people to stop recording \[(Figure 5)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230827041407026/unknown8.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963230827041407026/unknown8.png), which I'm assuming is because they knew what they were doing is some degenerate shit and didn't want SA to find out (oops). While these were just jokes, it doesn't really excuse the fact that this is some gross behavior.

&#x200B;

Fuck up #1 - lying to SA

Based off screenshots of the physical itinerary SARPA provided and the online one, we believe they lied to SA about their movie, claiming to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead \[(Figure 6)\], [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946602588466450542/963488601100943380/unknown\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/946602588466450542/963488601100943380/unknown_LI.jpg) despite the fact that on the google docs itinerary it stated hentai theater 3000, before they changed it back to mystery theater 3000 \[(figure 7)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231169929957396/Screenshot\_20220405-122439\_Sheets\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231169929957396/Screenshot_20220405-122439_Sheets_LI.jpg) and watching rape hentai instead. Them changing the printed version of the itinerary that was handed out at the event is a clear omission of guilt. What this means is that its very possible some people went to watch a normal movie just to be in a musty room watching ""Sextra Credit"" which apparently is about a student's revenge fantasy against his teachers, which involves heavy themes of rape. If you're curious look it up yourself.

&#x200B;

Fuck up #2 - possibly letting minors watch rape hentai with them

After finding out we knew and had some pretty damning evidence, leading members of SAPRA were now on full damage control trying to justify their watch party. Staff were told to ID everyone for the event, given they were apparently going to watch a rated-R movie (not rated X), however this wasn't possible due to staff constraints \[(figure 8) \][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231499329605723/InkedN2IIzDx\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231499329605723/InkedN2IIzDx_LI.jpg). This fuck up I'm personally sketched out the most by, since I personally have no idea who is conversing in these screenshots, the person who sent them hid them first. Regardless, it was a stupid ass idea to play hentai in a classroom in the first place.

&#x200B;

fuck up #3  - they've been doing this shit FOR YEARS

After some a little more scrolling through the SARPA server, you'll realize this wasn't the first time they've done this. Apparently, it's a yearly event that SARPA conducts as a sort of tradition \[(figure 9)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231241363156992/Picture5\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231241363156992/Picture5_LI.jpg).

\[(figure 10)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963307950435352586/figx.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963307950435352586/figx.jpg) Any benefit of the doubt I could've had with the SARPA organizers is gone now. I refuse to believe you're an organizer/admin of your club and you're unaware your fellow members are organizing their YEARLY hentai movie gathering (my DM's with organizer)\[(figure 11)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963311555347357696/unknown\_1.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963311555347357696/unknown_1.jpg).

&#x200B;

fuck up #4 - letting an old weirdo organize run your club

This is another point which is hard to make without leaking someone's personal information, but I believe the ""former member"" they're using as a scapegoat is the event organizer that on the itinerary for the watch party. According to their Facebook, they've been the club leader since 2011 \[(figure 12)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231017701892126/InkedAO69NGB\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231017701892126/InkedAO69NGB_LI.jpg). 20 fucking 11. Assuming their own Facebook page is accurate, that puts this guy in the age range of 29-33 which is beyond weird that he's organizing rape hentai viewing sessions for people he's nearly a decade older than. What makes him even creepier are his messages on the SARPA discord regarding the event.

&#x200B;

Their response

Now, as you could probably tell SARPA's admins are not happy and shitting their pants. They claim we raided their discord and are harassing them. Most would agree what we did was not ""raiding"" a discord. A friend of our was posting this meme \[(figure 13)\][https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231268072468530/mUNN7zE\_LI.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/856981560352047215/963231268072468530/mUNN7zE_LI.jpg) in their discord, and we wanted to see the reaction, so we joined in mass. Not a single one of us were even able to get a message out because their rule requires you to use your real full name on your profile (more on this later). However a single member, whom we don't even know, took it upon himself to do a bit of trolling, changing his name to antagonize them. If you count this single person changing his name to ""rape watch party"" or something along those lines and rejoining three times ""a raid"" then so be it. Now admittedly, I was very tempted to do a bit of trolling as well, mostly just wanted them to know how fucked they are, however I refrained, and never sent anything in their discord (not that we could've anyway). Another claim they make against us is that we doxxed one of their members, which is flat out wrong. One of our members, whom again, I don't know personally and have zero control over, saw that their admins had their real names as their discord profile, which is their rule, and looked it up on linkedIn. Keep in mind, we found this discord link on UBLinked, so their subreddit is pretty public with over 600 members. Maybe change your name on your **600** person discord. So to the person who's ""scared"" we want to dox them, don't be. We think you're absolutely vile and the last thing we want is to know is what you look like. Overall, they're realizing how fucked they are and are resorting to whatever straws they can grasp at, which will likely include slandering us. Consider the substantial amount of evidence I've presented when listening to their side.

&#x200B;

conclusion

As of typing this, neither SA nor the DEI office have acknowledged my email I've sent. Hopefully they are taking action against the organizers of that degenerate event. It's really a shame that the anime club has to live up to the stereotype of being creepy weirdos, because as a avid Japanese cartoon enjoyer, its really disappointing that these people are what represent us.

&#x200B;

I urge students to avoid SARPA, and especially Knox 110, those janitors ain't gonna clean shit.

P.S Q, go touch grass

edit: to the admins of SARPA who are purging their discord of every message I've included in my post, you were fucked the moment people saw the first 4 figures. The discord messages I included was me showing how depraved you are.

edit2: they deleted every channel on their discord, if you still weren't convinced.

Having said that, the sub has also really started to diverge from the community that it once was, and it’s really been suffering from some of the issues plaguing other parts of Reddit. Rampant shit posts, flame wars, ad hominem attacks, etc. have started to make this place less welcoming to newcomers, and we’ve already seen a number of posts by potential students worried that UB has a toxic community because of these things. We all share a degree of responsibility for this (I admit I’ve been a participant in the flame wars and bad behavior too), so it’s up to us to make a change. 

Commenters: 

Let’s keep things civil. Use the downvote for content you think isn’t worthwhile (i.e. shitposts). Don’t start a flame war or an ad hominem attack against the poster. If your argument why some post is bad involves you calling someone “autistic”, you need to re-evaluate how you’re choosing to communicate your thoughts to others, because you’re being an unhelpful asshole. This sub and the other redditors are not a punching bag to take your frustrations out on.

Posters:

Let’s try to remember that posts should be relevant to the community and interesting. This sub is a place to post content that other UB students, alumni, or potential students might enjoy. This place is not your diary. 

Mods:

You’ve done a great job bringing this revival of the sub about. Don’t let it go to shit now after all that work. Posts/comments that are obviously personal attacks against other redditors are 100% against Reddiquette and need to be removed, and repeat offenders need to be banned. I know that you are probably already doing this a ton, but a lot is being overlooked. If the recent influx of posts and comments are too much for you to handle, I’m sure there are some people here willing to step up and help out. We might also benefit from creating some additional sub rules of our own that specifically address shitposting and personal attacks.

Let’s all step up and improve the sub for our own sake and the sake of future potential students coming here to see if UB is a good fit for them.",2018-04-29 18:02:43

Everytime I see a meme about how we don't have a spring break I cant help but think back to a poll I made about student striking upon hearing that intial decision. It got a pretty pessimistic response and I got down voted to hell in the comments for voicing my 'feelings'. Yes, this post comes from an incredibly salty place but it is also to say I feel like a good chunk of why UB gets away with treating students like machines is because many of the students lie down and take it under the guise of being able to 'push through the struggle'. Not everything has to be a struggle, and you don't look stronger for choosing to let your mental health suffer at the hands of non-stop zoom meetings...you look like a sad clown who truly believes filing out the course evals is a better way to *really stick it to em*. If they're not listening to us when we don't follow their direction in protest, they're sure as hell not gonna listen to us when we put up with their nonsense and complain the ""right"" way, halfway through the semester, when our mentals have already been fried. Even if it was truly a stupid idea (sure there could be flaws, I won't argue that) there were enough people to vote that I would've expected at least a small bit of discussion, or for litterally anyone else to offer ideas on convincing administration. 

Now this GME thing is happening and showing us that yes, when people work togther, things sometimes happen, rigid ways of doing business sometimes break. I noticed some professors took it upon themselves to lighten to course work or even not assign anything this week....when we were supposed to be on break. They didn't need to do that; administration said really said ""by all means keep them just as busy this week if not more"". And yet they did.. they took it upon themselves to try to alleviate student stress. Even if admin did nothing, what professor is going to be the asshat that penalizes every student choosing to black out their zoom for the week in protest of no spring break. How are you gonna enforce a continuance in teaching when there are no students present to teach?  

Again, this venting is purely caused by my inability to harbor this much salt in my being at once. But yes,  from here on out I'll just keep my nose in my books and do my course work through the massive stress headache and depressies. Its fiiiiinnneee.

It does not make any sense to call students on campus from all over the world and make them pay thousands of dollars in tuition and offer them remote courses. Students come to UB for a reason and now that the covid situation is better we want our classes to be in person so that we get the practical experience in our core courses and have an opportunity to stay engaged.

I must say that I am honored to be mentioned, thought of and still remembered by some. Man, I can\'t believe half of the crap I used to come up with back in the day.\n\nProbably one of my best memories (way too many to actually get into right now) was the advent of forum football. The UUBNF had a large following of very diverse students and, it must have been around the year 2000, that a bunch of us started a weekend tradition of forum football to help (ha) with our inevitable hangover from the previous night. Forum Football lasted for quite a while. I even came back a year or two after graduating to see if it was still going and it was, a very pleasant surprise indeed.\n\nAnd the freaking flame wars I used to have with those douches Ambassador and Yoasif. Classic.\n\nI can only hope today\'s students have the same sense of community that we had. For such a large campus, I feel like we all really carved out our spots within it.\n\nMuch love!\n\nPS - VOTE FOR ROWDY!', 'Rushman\'s response to this post: ""Hadn\'t thought about that in forever.""\n\nOblishblot\'s response to this post: ""man, why\'d he mention ""Oblishblot"" next to all those douchebags, like ambassador?""', ""Gather 'round and listen to a history lesson here:\n\nUUBNF was created in the late 90s by a bunch of UB students for the growing file sharing network at the time. In the late 90s, people were sharing files on the UB dorm network using windows shares. Eventually the forum would grow and someone would create a search engine called Resnester that would index these shares.\n\nIn early September 2011, vegans were chalking North Campus, so the people of the UUBNF decided to chalk the campus in response to this, the day of their chalking: September 10th, 2011. This is how I found out about the forum. \n\nThe forum grew beyond file sharing and become a sort of community at UB. AIM and message boards were really the way to go, facebook was years away. \n\nWe had a mega photoshop battle thread, a second chalking event (this time a plane crashed into a building in Florida the day after). Parties were planned, friends were made, certain events (like the ONE time UB closed in my time there) were posted about. \nAs the forum grew older, so did its main users, by 2004, facebook came to UB and the original users of the UB forum began to graduate and move on. \n\nResnester was shut down sometime in 2003 and in its place direct connect hubs were created, (Bizzarro and others). The creators of these hubs were from UUBNF, however, they were shut down as well and around 2010, the forum was all but dead. Only alumni would come along once in awhile to post, and finally, after 16+ years, a relic of the last decade at UB, is gone. "", 'Great history - but I think you meant September 10, 2001, not 2011.

This is my second time taking CHE 121 and honestly I’m questioning if I should have even failed the first time, since she never allowed us to view the tests unless during office hours, which were during another class for me. Not only this but the one office hours I was able to attend be belittled me for asking for help. 

This class has negatively affected my mental health since her inability to admit to mistakes has negatively impacted my grades and has made me feel incompetent. She makes her students feel like failures as she refuses to admit that she can make a mistake. She addressed the previous reddit post about her but did not address the concern and instead trying to glorify herself and blame the computer program, which she inputted the answers for. Seriously, how difficult would it be to include multiple answers for a question or return points to a student who very clearly got a right answer.

Here is an except from a good post to illustrate to you the threat:\n\nLet\'s stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: ""*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* "" [\\[1\\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)\n\nSince H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you\'ve probably had it at one point or another -- it\'s just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...\n\nFirst off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it\'s one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\\[4\\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it\'ll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\\[5\\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&geo1=01). There\'s also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\\[6\\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/).\n\nBuddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\\[7\\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is \'Map Virus\' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that\'s how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one \'chad spreader\'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it\'ll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it\'s already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\\[8\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).\n\nWhat matters is that we can see that something like \\~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \\~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \\~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire...\n\nIf we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we\'ve got evidence of that already [\\[9\\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).\n\nBut that\'s not all. Italy is fucked. They just announced a quarantine of 1/4 of their fucking population [\\[10\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70). Take wild guess how that\'s going to fare for their economy. The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it\'s highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\\[11\\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what\'s going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.\n\nSo let\'s get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\\[12\\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \\~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.\n\nHowever, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we\'re looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\\[13\\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we\'re looking at a total of \\~60.8 million infected in a year\'s time. This corresponds to \\~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \\~1.16m people dead [\\[14\\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza).', 'Stop fearmongering, our age group has a fatality rate of .2% not the 2.5% that’s you’re claiming.
